Many of the organic search results we obtained are fueled by customer reviews. Social proof is a HUGE influencer in our marketing efforts. \r\n\r\nAnother extremely important aspect of Advocately is that we are able to identify our users who don't love the product.

Now, with Advocately, I just set up campaigns and they take care of the rest. We initially tested it out on 40 users and within that we produced 20 reviews!!!!! The same subset of users would probably would have produced 2 or 3 reviews within my old process. \r\n\r\nAlso, the support has been amazing! Patrick has extremely helpful at setting us up and guiding us through the onboarding process. He has been very flexible in the hours he has helped and I've always very quickly got a response to questions. "

A list view is much better and simpler.  Also, I think you guys should better figure out the right companies that should be in a respective category.

And the data you get about your pageviews is not good. You're handed IP addresses that get matched against a spotty database (e.g. you will see a lot of \"Comcast LLC viewed your page\") and that's it. Without refining that data to the individual lead level, it's hard to give real attribution value to the pageviews you see on G2C. Maybe it's a great first touch channel, but you'll never really know."

Without getting us this ROI data, there is an upper limit on how much we will pay for G2C. Adding it would allow us to pay more.\r\n\r\nWhen I have requests that require the help of a product or engineering team, the turnaround can be between a few days to a week or so.

First of all, as Customer Satisfaction is very important to us, we use it to gauge how happy our users genuinely are, with our products.  \r\n\r\nEqually as important, as a sales leader, we also use this site for references.  All prospects will eventually ask for references prior to making a purchase.  As our business unit is growing quickly, this can often cause reference fatigue as they are hit up over and over again.  Plus, IMO the reference process isn't perfect anyway for the prospect, as they will be biased.  So instead, we have our salespeople just point their prospects to G2Crowd instead.  \"Instead of me giving you the names of my 5 best customers, why don't you go to G2Crowd instead?  There you'll find verified reviews of actual users (not analysts that have never used the tools themselves), of our solution as well as our competitors.  And then from there you can do as many backdoor references as you'd like.\"  \r\n\r\nThis is win/win.  The prospect gets better reviews from users, that aren't prepped or set up....and we get our reference checks.  "

This allows our small marketing team to engage SMEs at G2 who hail from the Integration industry and know our business well.  We can then share our unique client stories with them and be creatively involved with the story we want to express to the B2B buyer who really relies on reviews and expert content when making decisions which affect not only yearly budgets but also sensitive data migration and integration compliance projects.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, all the research and infographics are easily shareable, which makes them a great asset to use in social media platforms, email campaigns, and other digital channels our marketing team use to inform potential integration software buyers.\r\n\r\nOverall, I could not say enough about the decision this 2017 to work with G2 to augment our product comparative marketing efforts.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to each year penciling them into our yearly marketing budget as well.\r\n\r\n~Clint\r\n@cazoomi"

We don't go out to eat somewhere new without checking out tripadvisor or yelp and we certainly don't book a holiday before checking out reviews and pictures from people who have actually been there.  G2Crowd brings this piece of mind to b2b software. It amazes that many companies still make significant purchasing decisions on outdated and obscure reviews from old school analysts who have probably never used the product.\r\n\r\nG2Crows is solving for a massively underserved market of buyer and sellers who could all do with more transparency and trust!\r\n\r\n"
