When I gave him the exact page in G2 that I was referring to it said \"I don't have access to live G2 database but I rely on set of structured database information which I currently lack for [my company's category].\"\r\n\r\nWhile we had initial traction in getting reviews once we signed the contract, that dried up quickly (after 1-2 months) and then we haven't gotten *any* reviews in the past half-year.\r\n\r\nI wish I got sentiment analytics on the page even if someone *didn't* leave a review. I wish there was a way to know how many users were \"watching us\" or whether they had a positive brand sentiment. I can see pageviews, but I wish I could tell if folks were \"subscribed\" to our brand. So we could push updated information to those who had more than passing interest."

They have plenty of features to help scale the customer voice into other teams and systems (e.g. reference pages, quote library, integrations with 6sense). It is simple enough for a team of one to learn quickly, but robust enough for an entire marketing org to find value out of it. More than anything, the direct support I've received from G2 has been huge in my continuing to advocate and find value in the platform. Our Account Manager and Customer Success Manager have become valued professional peers — it really feels like I've built a rapport with them. They are patient and not pushy and bring a consultative approach to our partnership."
