For our use case, 80% of the traffic was net new.\r\n2. Of the 20% we already had, a significant correlation was present to opportunities which shows value in the remaining 80%. This is continuing to test out positively.\r\n3. The total traffic was way too much to use (1k+ unique companies every few months with conversion rates below 2%), but thankfully you can see exactly what each company is looking at. Sorting unique hits by page type, and then seeing which page types correlates to opportunities, allows me to handpick a workable amount of net new Leads to deliver to my sales team which convert at a forecast of over 12% (average). Not bad for Leads we haven't even touched!"},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"My biggest hurtle with G2 was the Leads integration. I was told I \"could get the data any way I wanted\" prior to buying. When installing, and realizing it was missing this key feature, I pinged the team. They're still a little young, and therefore overpromised. \r\n\r\nHowever, this turned out to be a very positive experience, because they designed and implemented a new API specific to my needs, and fast. Turns out they could get it to me any way I wanted, I just had to wait a few weeks. I now have a Leads API that gets me the data, how and when I need it. They're already listening to the next product advancements, and I feel confident the product will continue to grow beyond its existing value, which is already at this point quite significant.\r\n\r\nThe team was fast, effective, and easy to work with during the update; Couldn't be happier. G2 boyscout here, if you're charged with Demand Generation, Lead Generation, Scoring, or most anything relevant with Leads - there's a way for you to leverage this data and get value by the boat load."},"recommendations":{"text":"Recommendations to others considering the product:","value":"Get a test data set. Forecast the ROI before making the investment.\r\nDo they have the traffic you need? (size, industry, etc.)\r\nHow much of it is unique and net new? (run the domains through your CRM)\r\nHow much of it correlates to Opps that you can use? (of those that match, which relate to Opps, are many DQ'd?)\r\n\r\nTake what you know of the Accounts that matched in your CRM, lay it over the Accounts that didn't (net new), forecast what you could get out of the net new based on the conversion rates by page type, company size, etc."},"benefits":{"text":"What problems is the product solving and how is that benefiting you?","value":"Too many to list here, but i'll cover the basics:\r\n1. Mapping data points with high correlations to Opps onto existing Accounts & routing them (behavioral scoring)\r\n2. Importing Net New companies with activity on data points with high correlations to Opps and routing them (lead gen)\r\n3. Identifying existing customers looking into the space to identify churn (churn prevention)\r\n4. Coming Soon - coloring in the Account. G2 has clearbit data, and the moment they finish porting everything into Salesforce i'll be using this to fill in if the company is the right fit via size, funding, etc. (demographic scoring)"}},"secondary_answers":{"meets_requirements":{"text":"Meets Requirements","value":6.0},"ease_of_use":{"text":"Ease of Use","value":6.0},"quality_of_support":{"text":"Quality of Support","value":7.0},"ease_of_admin":{"text":"Ease of Admin","value":7.0},"ease_of_doing_business_with":{"text":"Has the product been a good partner in doing business?","value":7.0}},"verified_current_user":true,"is_business_partner":true,"review_source":"Invitation from a seller or affiliate.

But, my problem is getting even close to that number to begin with. "},"recommendations":{"text":"Recommendations to others considering the product:","value":"Don't expect a ton of traffic or lead volume. For whatever reason this lead volume form G2 is significantly less than other review sites such as Capterra/GetApp/Software Advice, Best Company, Trust Radius, and similar sites. For the price, we should be getting at least 16 leads a month to be comparable to the average across my portfolio of 10 review sites (most of which are free). We have received 2 so far in 4 weeks.

Using G2, we can show our prospects a side-by-side comparison of how satisfied our customers are against each of our major competitors. These quantitative metrics have made a huge difference for us."},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"Overall, I like the way G2 looks at markets, but the way that G2 calculates \"Market Presence\"— the Y-axis in Grid Reports — could use some improvement. It uses 15 factors like Number of Employees, Revenue, Web Presence, and  Social Presence. This gives large companies with hundreds of products and thousands of employees a distinct advantage over specialists that are better known in a given market. Companies like IBM and Microsoft will always score well in Market Presence because of their sheer size, even if they have only a handful of employees working on a given product."},"recommendations":{"text":"Recommendations to others considering the product:","value":"If you have lots of happy customers and want to leverage them in sales cycles, this is a great way to do that."},"benefits":{"text":"What problems is the product solving and how is that benefiting you?","value":"G2 has allowed us to shorten our sales cycles and help eliminate weaker competitors from our sales cycles.
