**Survey Response Analysis**
The Survey Response Analysis project is designed to automate the process of fetching, processing, and analyzing survey responses from a data source using an API. The system extracts valuable insights from customer feedback to identify specific feature sets that customers are looking for in various products or services.

**Purpose**
In today's data-driven world, businesses rely heavily on customer feedback to improve their products and services. Analyzing survey responses manually can be time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to streamline the analysis process by leveraging automation and natural language processing techniques.

**Key Features**
Survey Response Fetching: The system retrieves survey responses from a specified API endpoint.

Data Processing and Summarization: It processes survey responses to extract key information such as product names, star ratings, feedback comments, and secondary answers.

Feature Generation: Using a pretrained language model, the system generates feature sets based on customer feedback to identify specific aspects or attributes that customers prioritize.

**Use Cases**
Market Research: Conduct comprehensive market research by analyzing large volumes of customer feedback data to understand customer preferences and requirements.

Product Development: Gain insights into desired features and functionalities to inform product development and enhancement strategies.

Customer Experience Improvement: Identify areas of improvement in customer experience based on feedback analysis.

**Getting Started**
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

**Prerequisites**
Python 3.x installed
Access token for the API (to be stored in config.json)

**Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/survey-response-analysis.git
cd survey-response-analysis
2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Configuration**
1. Obtain an access token for the API.
2.Create a config.json file in the project directory with the following structure:
{
  "API_KEY": "your-api-token-here"
}
Replace "your-api-token-here" with your actual API token.

**Usage**
1.Open main.py and ensure the BASE_URL constant is set to your API endpoint.
2.Execute the main script:
python main.py

The script will fetch survey responses, process them, and generate feature sets based on customer feedback using the provided access token.

**Code Structure**
main.py: Contains the main script to fetch survey responses and process them.
config.json: Stores the API access token (not included in version control).
requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages.
