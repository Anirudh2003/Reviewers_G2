I think that is extremely valuable to both shoppers and companies. G2 Crowd gets hundreds to thousands of people scrolling through their site daily, which offers a great amount of awareness to our product.\r\n\r\nOne other thing I HAVE to praise is the G2 Crowd staff. Bliss Billingsley was incredibly helpful throughout our training/implementation phase and was always quick to email or call when I had questions. Just last week she transitioned us along to Ashley McDermott, our Relationship Manager. While I'm sad to no longer work with Bliss, I'm equally as excited to work with Ashley and improve our ranking even more!"

G2 Crowd sends 3 emails to notify your customers to leave reviews and earn gift cards, but I was really hoping we'd be offered the chance to choose the dates of these emails. They sent all 3 emails back to back over a 3 day period, which in my opinion wasn't enough space between emails. Maybe just give customers the option in the future of when to send the emails.\r\n*Disclaimer: I may have had the option to choose and just forgot/didn't realize it..."

This allows us to communicate this action to sales which may help move the prospect through the pipeline. Our leads through G2 have picked up the more active we are with the site. \r\nThe G2Crowd banner is also in the footer of our website, and this helps with additional validity for prospects considering a TMS in the space. \r\nOur CSM Jess has genuinely been an extension of our company and helps us strategize and sets us up for success with our account."

Danny took extreme care to understand our company needs and expectations, and even sent us a signed \"thank-you\" note after our first webinar. (Who does this? Uhm...Danny does!) Our implementation specialist Kelly slowly and meticulously explained how to get our listing set-up. She transformed a super daunting job into very easy subtasks, and weekly met with us to review our progress. It was like eating an elephant, one bite at a time...but with less mandible engagement. Ashley, our main point of contact at G2 Crowd, has overseen our entire G2 Crowd journey, and is quick to resolve any concerns we have. Like, greased lightning fast!"
