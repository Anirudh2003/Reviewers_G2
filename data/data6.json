G2 stood out regarding team response, the information provided through the sales cycle, and the fact that it is all packaged together in one solution rather than pay-to-play. This option suits us better at this point. It's also easier to implement and get going with the review collection. I can't speak highly enough of Nathan and Jade, whom I work with on the G2 side - some of the best customer support I have experienced, and it's a joy to work with them. They share helpful tips and updates, which are really appreciated. That's what builds loyalty, and importantly they also deliver results!"
