What do I like best? Admin Portal ease-of-use. Platform is super intuitive. Intent data, marketing content and other analytics are easily accessible via MyG2 menu, no need to hunt. Customer reference pages are easy to build, too. Support from Customer Success is great."},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"We've not yet leveraged all of the paid features available to us, can only speak to those we have: nothing to dislike at this point, really. I do, at times, feel pressured, sometimes rushed, to utilize plan to fullest potential (understandably, as CS team is eager to prove value), and felt the onboarding process was hurried, though we're not quite there yet.

I like G2 because it's quick and easy for my customer to share their thoughts and feelings about their experience using my company's products. Partnering with my Enterprise Customer Success Manager, Carly Cozad, and Strategic Account Executive, Nick Espey, we've landed on the right strategy, which has allowed us to drive hundreds of new reviews. These reviews have lead to the creation of dozens of new pieces of marketing collateral. Even the occasional negative review has allowed our Customer Success and Support teams to get involved in monitoring reviews. I really like how we've been able to use our G2 profile as a lead generation source. Once the lead form is completed, I receive a notification and the lead is added to my instance of Salesforce so that I can track it."},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"My company is used across a number of different industries and is applicable across a lot of different user types.

I consider a customer's G2 review along with a few other data points when deciding which customers I want to invite to my advocacy program. The content we create by leveraging the review quotes has been some of our highest converting assets.

Having this in real-time or close to real-time can really increase my response rate. For example, I see they are looking at comparing vendors to one of my competitors. That tells me they are already in talks with that competitor and looking to see who else they should consider - enter me!\n\nThere are major upsides to using G2 not just for competitive comparisons but also to reflect on what your customer like and/or dislike. This can be great feedback for customer success teams and product teams! It also helps me understand what I need to do a better job of explaining specific features/use cases. \n\nI also love that I can get insights/alert via slack! I'm sure they have several integrations that would work for any b2b company."},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"Too many email notifications - I wish they wouldn't send repetitive alerts within the same week for the same company. It's overkill, but at the same time It makes sure I don't miss anything! I know they can't share personal information but that would obviously be great! Given you don't have insights into the person who was researching on g2, you have to get a little creative and leverage a larger net for your initial outreach. \n\nI don't like that the last review (video) is automatically the first thing a customer sees, if this isn't a good review but there are 8 others that are, why does it have to be highlighted? I feel like our company should get to choose which video is shown on our main page on G2. \n\nInformation isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims. Most are not from verified customers which makes me think, could this bad review be a competitor trying to tarnish my brand?"},"recommendations":{"text":"Recommendations to others considering the product:","value":"Buy it. Your competitors already have. :) \n\nBut seriously, this is worth the investment. I source so many opps/set meetings from these insights.

Realized compelling reviews can help me in my sales cycles in addition to my competitor's negative reviews. \n\nI learned how to narrow my outreach to the right persons I suspect to have triggered the g2 alert -  you can always check out location data and use that as a filter in LinkedIn sales Nav.\n\nI also realized how much motivation the insights provide me and my team.. prospecting can be disheartening at times and having a little extra help can go a long way!\n\nIn regard to my dislike (see below) I love that we can respond to reviews left by customers.  \"Information isn't always accurate that is left by our customers, I can specifically see where they have made false claims.

The first month we used G2, we were in the leaderboard quadrant as a top 3 solution. We did a big promotion with our top 3 standing that went out to customers and future buyers. After this campaign promoting our G2 standing, our marketing manager realized that G2 had tagged us with the wrong employee count, so we contacted them to fix it. After G2 corrected the employee count, we moved to the lowest ranking offering (down 6 spots) with no other change than our number of employees. G2 met with us to review this error and didn't provide any clarity except that their algorithm emphasizes better scores for larger companies. This logic seems ridiculous because if a company is large, it doesn't mean that the specific product reviewed is superior to a smaller company. Often, smaller companies have superior products because it's their primary focus. G2 promised to get back to us to solve this mistake, but we haven't heard back from them in weeks. We've found the experience with G2 to be very disappointing and borderline dishonest. I'm not hopeful that we'll hear back from them.
