Despite needing a large upfront payment, it tends to prove more cost-effective in the long term than some of the biddable PPC directories, where you ultimately end up driving up the PPC every month but the number of clicks and leads remain the same.\r\n\r\nOur account and customer success managers, Austin and Michael, have both been great in helping us to optimise our profile and get the most out of our G2 package.\r\n\r\nAlso, really like the new profile sections in the software categories, with the addition of extra data and ratings info."},"hate":{"text":"What do you dislike about the product?","value":"Price increase for renewal was quite a jump in 2022, which wasn't ideal.\r\n\r\nGathering reviews can be difficult due to the need for customers to have to log into G2 in order for them to be validated.  Obviously we understand the need to ensure reviews are genuine and of high quality, but we do get regular push-back from our customers who are willing to leave a review, but have abandoned their review or just won't complete one due to the login requirement and length of the questionnaire.  The screenshot aspect in particular has proved an annoyance for many.\r\n\r\nIt's a shame badges awarded to software providers are not displayed alongside each providers profile on the software category list.  It'd be a great addition to add extra kudos to profiles."},"benefits":{"text":"What problems is the product solving and how is that benefiting you?","value":"G2 has helped us to better understand our position in the marketplace of employee intranets and communications.  It's helped drive new leads while providing us with the tools to gain a greater insight into our visitor audience.
