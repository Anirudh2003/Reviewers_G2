Our CSMs have always been extremely responsive. I do not say this lightly when I say, I truly feel like we are the CSMs only clients.\r\n\r\nThe vendor portal is astronomically easier to use than other review vendors on the market. It's very easy to navigate and it's very easy to identify what needs to be or can be updated on your organization's upgraded product profile listing. \r\n\r\nImplementation was smooth and quick, and each year we renew, the team works hard to lay out only our options that are truly the best for our organization.\r\n\r\nIntegrations are also very simple. We itegrate with Salesforce, Marketo, Demandbase, Influitive, Salesloft, Pendo, Leandata, and Zoominfo, and each connection was very easy to navigate. Our CSMs helped facilitate all of these integretions and connected us with their in-house ops team as well as provided easy-to-follow instructions to make these integrations run smoothly. They were very patient and made sure to test things multiple times and ensure everything worked perfect. \r\n\r\nReview generation campaigns are also extremely easy to run with G2 and super simple too. We send them a list, a budget, and..that's it. They take it from there. The results we see from these campaigns is better than any other review vendor we use. We get good quality reviews from these efforts which helps us show up well on quarterly reports and earn tons of badges which we frequently use for marketing purposes.\r\n\r\nBuyer intent data management is very simple and affective with the G2 portal. We receive leads directly into our internal database and can easily pull reports and list distrobutions of a particular moment in time if we want too. We run several competitor campaings and alwsy use the various G2 intent signals to really hone our target. You can get as broad or as grainular with the targeting with G2 buyer intent data.\r\n\r\nG2 is a tool I use every day so it's something I need to work well all the time. Compared to other review vendors, the portal is always running well and ive experienced little to no system errors."

But if you reach out to your CSM, they'll get that for you very quickly."

We utilize our earned badges and our quarterly reports in our marketing efforts so much. We are much more motivated to run review campaigns and/or keep our profile updated to get the best results whether it be in organic traffic, conversion, lead flow, etc. G2 works very hard to help you help your company be the best customer-facing profile it can be for your key buyers. Additionally, they make all the marketing assets easily accessible and the CSMs are really good at suggesting where and how to present badges, reports, grid images, and more."

I wish that the platform offered an annual or bi-annual option for all vendors to load funds for an ad-hoc review collection campaign without vendors having to pay for an entire subscription. Also, we gather many reviews through review sourcing campaigns, but the reviews often times aren't the highest quality, because the review form is very simple. I wish their was a middle ground of the intricateness of the G2 & TR review forms. There is also a frequent tech issues that I run into when I'm inside the vendor portal. When I'm switching from a subscribed product to a non-subscribed product and back to a subscribed product, the subscribed product info begins to display like a non-subscribed product. I always have to refresh the page and navigate directly back to the subscribed product for the normal view to resume."
